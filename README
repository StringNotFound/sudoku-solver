This program solves sudoku puzzles

To use, execute sudoku.py with python. You then need
to input the sudoku. An example valid input is below:

0 6 4 9 3 0 0 2 0
0 0 9 4 8 0 6 0 0
0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 3
4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 6
0 3 0 1 7 8 0 9 0
9 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 2
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0
0 0 8 0 6 1 5 0 0
0 4 0 0 9 7 3 1 0

0 represents an unknown value. The program will
solve for all unknown values and print out the
result. The output is only well-defined for solvable
sudokus. If there are multiple possible solutions,
the algorithm will return one of the solutions.
